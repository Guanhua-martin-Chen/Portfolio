## Featured Projects

### 1. [Cross-Dataset Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (CS260D Final Project)](https://github.com/TonyZhu2002/Cross-Dataset-LTH)
A research-oriented project investigating whether **sequential pruning across multiple datasets** can produce more **universal sparse subnetworks** under the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.  
Implemented a full **cross-dataset iterative magnitude pruning (IMP)** pipeline using MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and evaluated transfer performance on unseen **grayscale CIFAR-10**.  
Built a reproducible PyTorch framework with staged pruning, mask-freezing logic, and comprehensive evaluation including accuracy curves and confusion matrices.

### 2. [Immune Cell Composition Analysis](https://github.com/Guanhua-martin-Chen/Transcriptomic-Signatures-of-Host-Cytokine-Responses-Reveal-Determinants-of-virus-Infection-Outcomes)
A transcriptomics-based analysis of immune-cell composition in infected individuals.  
Built a complete R pipeline including transcript → gene aggregation, blood-cell xCell inference, metadata alignment, Wilcoxon/CLR statistical testing, and cohort-level summary visualizations.  
Generated final barplots and DSSO-based trends highlighting immune shifts across disease states.

### 3. [Explore IMDB Movies](https://github.com/Guanhua-martin-Chen/Explore-IMDB-Movies)
Exploratory data analysis using IMDB datasets to study how ratings relate to genres, runtime, and production factors.  
Includes data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling to identify contributors to movie success.
