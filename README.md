## About Me
I’m **Guanhua Chen**, a data scientist with strong training in **statistics, machine learning, and applied mathematics**, and a growing focus on **research-driven and system-level ML problems**.  
I am currently pursuing a **Master of Engineering in Data Science at UCLA**.

I earned my **B.S. in Statistics (Data Science Option)** with a **minor in Applied Mathematics** from the **University of Washington**, where I built a solid foundation in statistical modeling, experimental design, and data analysis.

My interests include **machine learning generalization and efficiency**, **AI-driven healthcare analytics**, **cloud and computing performance optimization**, and **quantitative financial modeling**.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Cross-Dataset Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
🔗 https://github.com/TonyZhu2002/Cross-Dataset-LTH  

A research-oriented project exploring whether **sequential pruning across multiple datasets** can produce more **universal sparse subnetworks** under the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH).  
Implemented a full **cross-dataset iterative magnitude pruning (IMP)** pipeline using MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and evaluated transfer performance on unseen **grayscale CIFAR-10**.  
Built a reproducible PyTorch framework with checkpointed pruning stages, mask-freezing logic, and comprehensive evaluation including accuracy curves, confusion matrices, and per-class analysis.  
Results show cross-dataset tickets outperform single-dataset and random sparse baselines at high sparsity, suggesting improved transferability.

### 2. Immune Cell Composition Analysis
🔗 https://github.com/Guanhua-martin-Chen/Transcriptomic-Signatures-of-Host-Cytokine-Responses-Reveal-Determinants-of-virus-Infection-Outcomes  

A transcriptomics-based analysis of blood immune-cell composition across infection stages.  
Built an end-to-end pipeline including transcript-to-gene aggregation, **xCell enrichment (blood cell types)**, metadata alignment, Wilcoxon and CLR-based statistical testing, and publication-ready visualizations.  
Produced PI-requested comparative bar plots and DSSO-based temporal trends to highlight immune shifts across disease severity groups.

### 3. Explore IMDB Movies
🔗 https://github.com/Guanhua-martin-Chen/Explore-IMDB-Movies  

An exploratory data analysis project using IMDB datasets to study audience ratings, genres, and production factors.  
Performed data cleaning, visualization, and regression analysis to identify features associated with movie success.

### 4. Evaluating Basketball Shoes
🔗 https://github.com/Guanhua-martin-Chen/Evaluating-Basketball-Shoes  

A data-driven comparison of basketball shoes based on performance metrics and player feedback.  
Applied clustering and regression techniques to identify attributes correlated with user ratings and preferences.
